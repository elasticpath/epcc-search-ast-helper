# EPCC Search AST Helper

## Introduction

This project is designed to help consume the `EP-Internal-Search-Ast-v*` headers. In particular, it provides functions for processing these headers in a variety of use cases.


### Retrieving an AST
The `GetAst()` function will convert the JSON header into a struct that can be then be processed by other functions:

```go
package example

import epsearchast_v3 "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3"

func Example(headerValue string) (*epsearchast_v3.AstNode, error) {
	
	ast, err := epsearchast_v3.GetAst(headerValue)
	
	if err != nil { 
		return nil, err
    } else { 
		return ast, nil
    }
	
}

```

If the error that comes back is a ValidationErr you should treat it as a 400 to the caller.


### Aliases

This package provides a way to support aliases for fields, this will allow a user to specify multiple different names for a field, and still have it validated and converted properly:

```go
package example

import epsearchast_v3 "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3"

func Example(ast *epsearchast_v3.AstNode) error {
	
	//The ast from the user will be converted into a new one, and if the user specified a payment_status field, the new ast will have it recorded as status. 
	aliasedAst, err := ApplyAliases(ast, map[string]string{"payment_status": "status"})

	if err != nil { 
		return err
    }
	
	DoSomethingElse(aliasedAst)
	
	return err
}
```

#### Regular Expressions

Aliases can also match Regular Expressions. Regular expresses are specified starting with the `^` and ending with `$`, as the key to the alias. The regular expression can include capture groups and use the same syntax as [Regexp.Expand()](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.Expand) to refer to the groups in the replacement (e.g., `$1`).

**Note**: Regular expressions are an advanced use case, and care is needed as the validation involved is maybe more limited than expected. In general if more than one regular expression can a key, then it's not defined which one will be used. Some errors may only be caught at runtime.

**Note**: Another catch concerns the fact that `.` is a wild card in regex and often a path separator in JSON, so if you aren't careful you can allow or create inconsistent rules. In general, you should escape `.` in separators to `\.` and use `([^.]+)` to match a wild card part of the attribute name (or maybe even `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`) 

**Incorrect**: `^attributes.locales..+.description$` - This would match `attributesXlocalesXXXdescription`, it would also match `attributes.locales.en-US.foo.bar.description`

**Correct**: `^attributes\.locales\.([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)\.description$`

### Validation

This package provides a concise way to validate that the operators and fields specified in the header are permitted, as well as constrain the allowed values to specific types such as Boolean, Int64, and Float64:

```go
package example

import epsearchast_v3 "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3"

func Example(ast *epsearchast_v3.AstNode) error {
	var err error
	// The following is an implementation of all the filter operators for orders https://elasticpath.dev/docs/orders/orders-api/orders-api-overview#filtering
	err = epsearchast_v3.ValidateAstFieldAndOperators(ast, map[string][]string {
		"status": {"eq"},
		"payment": {"eq"},
		"shipping": {"eq"},
		"name": {"eq", "like"},
		"email": {"eq", "like"},
		"customer_id": {"eq", "like"},
		"account_id": {"eq", "like"},
		"account_member_id": {"eq", "like"},
		"contact.name": {"eq", "like"},
		"contact.email": {"eq", "like"},
		"shipping_postcode": {"eq", "like"},
		"billing_postcode": {"eq", "like"},
		"with_tax": {"gt", "ge", "lt", "le"},
		"without_tax": {"gt", "ge", "lt", "le"},
		"currency": {"eq"},
		"product_id": {"eq"},
		"product_sku": {"eq"},
		"created_at": {"eq", "gt", "ge", "lt", "le"},
		"updated_at": {"eq", "gt", "ge", "lt", "le"}, 
    })
	
	if err != nil { 
		return err
    }
	
	// You can additionally create aliases which allows for one field to reference another:
	// In this case any headers that search for a field of `order_status` will be mapped to `status` and use those rules instead. 
	err = epsearchast_v3.ValidateAstFieldAndOperatorsWithAliases(ast, map[string][]string {"status": {"eq"}}, map[string]string {"order_status": "status"})
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	
	// You can also supply validators on fields, which may be necessary in some cases depending on your data model or to improve user experience.
	// Validation is provided by the go-playground/validator package https://github.com/go-playground/validator#usage-and-documentation
	err = epsearchast_v3.ValidateAstFieldAndOperatorsWithValueValidation(ast, map[string][]string {"status": {"eq"}}, map[string]string {"status": "oneof=incomplete complete processing cancelled"})
	
	if err != nil {
		return err
    }
	
	// Finally you can also restrict certain fields to types, which may be necessary in some cases depending on your data model or to improve user experience.
   err = epsearchast_v3.ValidateAstFieldAndOperatorsWithFieldTypes(ast, map[string][]string {"with_tax": {"eq"}}, map[string]epsearchast_v3.FieldType{"with_tax": epsearchast_v3.Int64})

   if err != nil {
      return err
   }
   
   // All of these options together can be done with  epsearchast_v3.ValidateAstFieldAndOperatorsWithAliasesAndValueValidationAndFieldTypes
	return err
}
```

#### OR Filter Restrictions

By default, when using validation in this library, it will cap the complexity of OR queries to 4. The terminology we use internally is effective index intersection count and conceptually it is computed as follows:

1. The value is 1 for every leaf node in the AST.
2. For AND nodes it is the product of the children.
3. For OR nodes it is the sum of the children.

For example if you were searching for (a=1 OR b=2) AND (c=3 OR d=4 OR e=5), we compute that there might be 6 index intersections needed, (a=1,c=3),(a=1,d=4),(a=1,e=5),... This provides a heuristic to cap costs and prevent 
runaway queries from being generated. It was actually intended that we look at the number of index scans needed, and maybe that's a closer measure to expense in the DB, but the math would only be slightly different.

Over time this value and argument might change as we get more experience, in the interm you can use 0 as a value to allow everything (say if the collection is small).

#### Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions can also be set when using the Validation functions, the same rules apply as for aliases (see above). In general aliases are resolved prior to validation rules and operator checks.

### Generating Queries

#### GORM/SQL

The following examples shows how to generate a Gorm query with this library.

```go
package example

import epsearchast_v3 "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3"
import epsearchast_v3_gorm "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3/gorm"
import "gorm.io/gorm"

func Example(ast *epsearchast_v3.AstNode, query *gorm.DB, tenantBoundaryId string) error {
	var err error
	
	// Not Shown: Validation
	
	// Create query builder
	var qb epsearchast_v3.SemanticReducer[epsearchast_v3_gorm.SubQuery] = epsearchast_v3_gorm.DefaultGormQueryBuilder{}

	
	sq, err := epsearchast_v3.SemanticReduceAst(ast, qb)

	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Don't forget to add additional filters 
	query.Where("tenant_boundary_id = ?", tenantBoundaryId)
	
	// Don't forget to expand the Args argument with ...
	query.Where(sq.Clause, sq.Args...)
}
```


##### Limitations

1. The GORM builder does not support aliases (easy MR to fix).
2. The GORM builder does not support joins (fixable in theory).
3. There is no way currently to specify the type of a field for SQL, which means everything gets written as a string today (fixable with MR).
4. The `text` operator implementation makes a number of assumptions, and you likely will want to override its implementation:
   * English is hard coded as the language.
   * Postgres recommends using a [distinct tsvector column and using a stored generated column](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-tables.html#TEXTSEARCH-TABLES-INDEX). The current implementation does not support this and, you would need to override the method to support it. A simple MR could be made to allow for the Gorm query builder to know if there is a tsvector column and use that.

##### Advanced Customization

In some cases you may want to change the behaviour of the generated SQL, the following example shows how to do that
in this case, we want all eq queries for emails to use the lower case, comparison, and for cart_items field to be numeric.

```go
package example

import (
	epsearchast_v3 "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3"
	"strconv"
)
import epsearchast_v3_gorm "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3/gorm"
import "gorm.io/gorm"


func Example(ast *epsearchast_v3.AstNode, query *gorm.DB, tenantBoundaryId string) error {
	var err error

	// Not Shown: Validation

	// Create query builder
	var qb epsearchast_v3.SemanticReducer[epsearchast_v3_gorm.SubQuery] = &CustomQueryBuilder{}

	sq, err := epsearchast_v3.SemanticReduceAst(ast, qb)

	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Don't forget to add additional filters 
	query.Where("tenant_boundary_id = ?", tenantBoundaryId)
	
	// Don't forget to expand the Args argument with ...
	query.Where(sq.Clause, sq.Args...)
}

type CustomQueryBuilder struct {
	epsearchast_v3_gorm.DefaultGormQueryBuilder
}

func (l *CustomQueryBuilder) VisitEq(first, second string) (*epsearchast_v3_gorm.SubQuery, error) {
	if first == "email" {
		return &epsearchast_v3_gorm.SubQuery{
			Clause: fmt.Sprintf("LOWER(%s::text) = LOWER(?)", first),
			Args:   []interface{}{second},
		}, nil
	} else if first == "cart_items" {
		n, err := strconv.Atoi(second)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		return &epsearchast_v3_gorm.SubQuery{
			Clause: fmt.Sprintf("%s = ?", first),
			Args:   []interface{}{n},
		}, nil
	} else {
		return DefaultGormQueryBuilder.VisitEq(l.DefaultGormQueryBuilder, first, second)
	}
}
```

#### Mongo

The following examples shows how to generate a Mongo Query with this library.

```go
package example

import (
	"context"
	epsearchast_v3 "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3"
	epsearchast_v3_mongo "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3/mongo"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
)

func Example(ast *epsearchast_v3.AstNode, collection *mongo.Collection, tenantBoundaryQuery bson.M)  (*mongo.Cursor, error) {
	// Not Shown: Validation

	// Create query builder
	var qb epsearchast_v3.SemanticReducer[bson.D] = DefaultMongoQueryBuilder{}

	// Create Query Object
	queryObj, err := epsearchast_v3.SemanticReduceAst(ast, qb)

	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	mongoQuery := bson.D{
		{"$and",
			bson.A{
				tenantBoundaryQuery,
				queryObj,
			},
		}}
	
	
	return collection.Find(context.TODO(), mongoQuery)
}
```


##### Limitations

1. The Mongo Query builder is designed to produce filter compatible with the [filter argument in a Query](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/fundamentals/crud/read-operations/query-document/#specify-a-query), if a field in the API is a projection that requires computation via the aggregation pipeline, then we would likely need code changes to support that.
2. The [$text](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/reference/operator/query/text/#behavior) operator in Mongo has a number of limitations that make it unsuitable for arbitrary queries. In particular in mongo you can only search a collection, not fields for text data, and you must declare a text index. This means that any supplied field in the filter, is just dropped. It is recommended that when using `text` with Mongo, you only allow users to search `text(*,search)` , i.e., force them to use a wildcard as the field name. It is also recommended that you use a [Wildcard](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/index-text/create-wildcard-text-index/) index to avoid the need of having to remove and modify it over time.

##### Advanced Customization


###### Field Types

In some cases, depending on how data is stored in Mongo you might need to instruct the query builder what the type of the field is. The following example shows how to do that in this case we want to specify that `with_tax` is a number.

```go
package example

import (
	"context"
	epsearchast_v3 "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3"
	epsearchast_v3_mongo "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3/mongo"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
	"strings"
)

func Example(ast *epsearchast_v3.AstNode, collection *mongo.Collection, tenantBoundaryQuery *bson.M)  (*mongo.Cursor, error) {
	// Not Shown: Validation

	// Create query builder
	var qb epsearchast_v3.SemanticReducer[bson.D] = &epsearchast_v3_mongo.DefaultMongoQueryBuilder{
		FieldTypes: map[string]epsearchast_v3_mongo.FieldType{"with_tax": epsearchast_v3_mongo.Int64},
    }

	// Create Query Object
	queryObj, err := epsearchast_v3.SemanticReduceAst(ast, qb)

	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	mongoQuery := bson.D{
		{"$and",
			bson.A{
				tenantBoundaryQuery,
				queryObj,
			},
		}}
	
	return collection.Find(context.TODO(), mongoQuery)
}
```

###### Custom Queries

In some cases you may want to change the behaviour of the generated Mongo, the following example shows how to do that in this case we want to change emails because
we store them only in lower case in the db.

```go
package example

import (
	"context"
	epsearchast_v3 "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3"
	epsearchast_v3_mongo "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3/mongo"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
	"strings"
)

func Example(ast *epsearchast_v3.AstNode, collection *mongo.Collection, tenantBoundaryQuery *bson.M)  (*mongo.Cursor, error) {
	// Not Shown: Validation

	// Create query builder
	var qb epsearchast_v3.SemanticReducer[bson.D] = &LowerCaseEmail{}

	// Create Query Object
	queryObj, err := epsearchast_v3.SemanticReduceAst(ast, qb)

	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	mongoQuery := bson.D{
		{"$and",
			bson.A{
				tenantBoundaryQuery,
				queryObj,
			},
		}}
	
	return collection.Find(context.TODO(), mongoQuery)
}

type LowerCaseEmail struct {
	epsearchast_v3_mongo.DefaultMongoQueryBuilder
}

func (l *LowerCaseEmail) VisitEq(first, second string) (*bson.D, error) {
	if first == "email" {
		return &bson.D{{first, bson.D{{"$eq", strings.ToLower(second)}}}}, nil
	} else {
		return DefaultMongoQueryBuilder.VisitEq(l.DefaultMongoQueryBuilder, first, second)
	}
}
```

You can of course use the `FieldTypes` and `CustomQueryBuilder` together.

#### Elastic Search (Open Search)

The following examples shows how to generate a Elastic Search Query with this library.

```go
package example
import epsearchast_v3 "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3"
import epsearchast_v3_es "github.com/elasticpath/epcc-search-ast-helper/external/epsearchast/v3/els"


var qb = &LowerCaseEmail{
   epsearchast_v3_es.DefaultEsQueryBuilder{
      OpTypeToFieldNames: map[string]*epsearchast_v3_es.OperatorTypeToMultiFieldName{
         "status": {
            Wildcard: "status.wildcard",
         },
      },
   },
}

func init() {
	// Check all the options are valid.
	// Doing this in an init method, ensures that you don't have issues at runtime.
    qb.MustValidate()	
}

func Example(ast *epsearchast_v3.AstNode, tenantBoundaryId string)  (string, error) {
   // Not Shown: Validation
	

   // Create Query Object
   query, err := epsearchast_v3.SemanticReduceAst[epsearchast_v3_es.JsonObject](astNode, qb)

   if err != nil {
      return nil, err
   }
   
   // Verification
   queryJson, err := json.MarshalIndent(query, "", "  ")

}

type LowerCaseEmail struct {
   epsearchast_v3_es.DefaultEsQueryBuilder
}

func (l *LowerCaseEmail) VisitEq(first, second string) (*epsearchast_v3_es.JsonObject, error) {
   if first == "email" {
      return epsearchast_v3_es.DefaultEsQueryBuilder.VisitEq(l.DefaultEsQueryBuilder, first, strings.ToLower(second))
   } else {
      return epsearchast_v3_es.DefaultEsQueryBuilder.VisitEq(l.DefaultEsQueryBuilder, first, second)
   }
}

```



##### Limitations

1. There is no support for [Null Values](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/supported-field-types/index/#null-value), so while the is_null key is supported it defaults to empty
   * An MR would be welcome to fix this.
2. Elastic/OpenSearch do not by default ensure that objects retain their relations (e.g, you can't search for nested subobjects that have the AND of two properties). In order to support this you need to use [Nested Objects](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/supported-field-types/nested/).
3. You cannot use the is_null operator with nested fields.
   * It's unclear whether or not this could actually be supported nicely.

##### Advanced Customization

###### Field Types

Elastic Search may store the same field in multiple ways using [multi-fields](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/supported-field-types/index/#multifields), and depending on the operator being used you might need to use a different field (e.g., `text(a,"hello")` could use a `text` field called `a`, but `eq(a,"hello")` might need the `keyword` field `a.keyword`).
You can use the OpTypeToFieldNames map to essentially change the field to look at based on the operator type, check the code but there are essentially a number of classes, such as equality, relational, text, array, and wildcard. 

###### Nested Subqueries

Elastic Search doesn't natively support arrays, and so you can't easily support filters such as `eq(parent[0].id,)` or `text(locale.FR.description,"touté")` natively.

This library includes support for creating these nested fields provided that you have an index element on each field. Please see the integration tests, for examples of how to use this feature.

### FAQ

#### Design

##### Why does validation include alias resolution, why not process aliases first?

When validation errors occur, those errors go back to the user, so telling the user the error that occurred using the term they specified improves usability.
